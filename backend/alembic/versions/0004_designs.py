"""add designs.client/notes, formula_designs, inventory_transactions.design_id

Revision ID: 0004_designs
Revises: 0003_inventory
Create Date: 2026-08-30

Additive, handwritten migration growing the schema from the Fase 3 baseline
(0003_inventory) to eleven domain tables: it adds the nullable
``client``/``notes`` columns to ``designs`` (designs spec "Client Field"/
"Notes Field"), creates ``formula_designs`` — the formula↔design usage link
with a REAL ``UNIQUE(formula_id, design_id)`` constraint (formula-designs
spec "Formula-Design Link Data Model", design D2) — and adds the nullable
``design_id`` to ``inventory_transactions`` (inventory spec "Design
Reference on Consumption Transactions"). No Fase 1/2/3 table or column is
touched apart from those nullable additions.

The downgrade drops exactly the 0004 additions — the new table and the three
new columns — leaving every Fase 1/2/3 table and row intact (spec scenarios
"Downgrade is additive-safe"): it never removes pre-existing columns, so the
downgrade cannot destroy older data.

Column types mirror the SQLAlchemy 2.0 models in
``app/modules/designs/models.py`` (``Design``/``FormulaDesign``) and
``app/modules/inventory/models.py`` (``InventoryTransaction``): the
``source`` enum is stored as VARCHAR (SQLite has no native enum, design
ADR-5), timestamps as naive-UTC DATETIME.
