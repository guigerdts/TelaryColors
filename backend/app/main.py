"""Application entry point.

Boot: ``python -m uvicorn app.main:app`` from the backend venv
(never the PATH ``uvicorn`` binary — broken Termux stub).

Single-origin deployment (base spec REQ-04, design ADR-2): this app serves
the REST API under /api/v1 AND the built SPA from the same origin — no
CORS. Stored photo uploads are served at /uploads through a guarded static
route mounted before the SPA. The SPA build is served from ``frontend/dist``
at ``/`` whenever the directory exists at app-creation time; without a
build the mount is skipped (html=True needs the directory to exist), so
API-only deployments and the test suite are unaffected.

    instead yields (``Match.NONE``) for non-HTTP scopes and for any path under
    ``/api/`` or ``/uploads/``, letting the router keep walking to the API and
    uploads routes; everything else is served from ``frontend/dist``.

    Unlike a bare ``StaticFiles(html=True)`` — which only turns *directory*
    requests into ``index.html`` and returns 404 for arbitrary client-routed
    paths such as ``/search`` or ``/formulas`` — this handler resolves the
    requested path against the build directory through a safe, path-traversal
    guarded ``lookup_path`` and serves it when it is a real file (e.g. the
    bundled ``/assets/*.js`` and ``/assets/*.css``), otherwise it falls back to
    ``index.html`` so React Router handles the route (SPA refresh / deep-link
    fallback, bugfix). The ``/uploads/`` guard mirrors ``_UploadsRoute`` so the
    SPA catch-all can never capture upload paths even if the upload route is
    re-ordered (ADR-2 double guard, order-independent).
